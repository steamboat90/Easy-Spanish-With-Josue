Hello everyone, and welcome to Easy Spanish with Josue. The purpose of this podcast is to give you an opportunity to practice your Spanish listening comprehension with slow, easy, and beginner-friendly spanish. 

Each episode is accompanied by a transcript so you can follow along as I speak. If you don’t understand a certain word, you should pause the playback, learn the definition, and return. This is the best way to expand your vocabulary and enhance your listening skills. I also recommend returning to episodes you have already listened to until you can understand them fully. 

Thank you for joining me! ¡Hasta luego!
